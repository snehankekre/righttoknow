Together, we explore the role of technology in young people’s lives, and how it can be used to improve the mental health and wellbeing of young people aged 12 to 25.
The Young and Well CRC is investigating and building supportive online tools and environments to promote young people’s wellbeing and safety online; utilising technologies as facilitators of good mental health for vulnerable young people; and developing innovative services for those experiencing mental health difficulties.
Expected impacts include a reduction in youth suicide, suicide attempts and self-harm; a reduction in depression, anxiety, substance use and social isolation; and an improvement in quality of life for young people, their families and their communities.
